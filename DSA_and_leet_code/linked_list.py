# A linked list is a linear Data Structure, in which the elements are not stored 
# at contigious memory allocations. The elements in a linked list are linked one
# one after the other like a train bogies

# A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list.
# the first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value
# head is NULL. Each node in a list consists of atleast two parts
# ---- Data
# ---- Pointer (or Reference) to the next node

# Below code shows an example of a linked list
